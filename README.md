# Algorithms &amp; Collections &nbsp; 

The algorithms and collections module taught unsuprisingly algorithms and collections. It was assessed with both an exam and a coding assignment. All algorithms and collection tutorials and lectures were taught using Java and the Java Collection Framework. Even though the course until this point had only focused on C++ this gave students a new opportunity to better understand a new and popular language as well as learning fundamental
 
## Assignment

The assignment was to take a basic binary tree implementation and extended the implementation to an extended binary tree which would rotate tree nodes to stay consistent with an AVL binary tree or red black tree. In addition we had to produce test results to show the new functionality worked and combine it in a report to state the approach to the problem.

## Submission

A full extensive report was given, as was the Java which met all requirements of the assignment which included a full implementation of an extended binary tree and code which could serialise and deserialise it from disk.
